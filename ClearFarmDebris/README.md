# Clear Farm Debris

Original Mod Updated from [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/26715) by [David Renne (aka golanggopher)](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/168938363)

Farm gets cleared of trees, bushes, rocks, weeds, stumps, logs, boulders, grass, and random event objects. Perfect for new saves and using other mods where you dont need the resources to build your farm out.
